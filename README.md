# Cardinail
Clinically focused AI system for nail analysis. Captures high-res nail images and uses explainable deep learning to detect signs (color, pitting, ridges, clubbing, etc.). Maps findings via medical rules + probabilistic model to differential diagnoses (cardiac, liver, anemia, fungal, psoriasis, etc.).
